          urban planners and architectural technicians. The company is directed by partners Ștefan Nedelcu, Radu Barota and Matei Vlăsceanu, architects and
          entrepreneurs with extensive experience in both design and general construction management, in Romania as well as abroad (USA, Singapore, Netherlands, Hong Kong).</p>
        <p class="intro-text">Our goal is to create vibrant, sustainable buildings that reach beyond themselves and become of durable value to the user, to
          the society and the culture that they are built into. We shape and challange the physical environment – from masterplans, urban spaces and buildings
          to interior design, – with the overall objective of providing the user with a strong, visionary and thoroughly prepared design, adapted to the specific
          context. Our ideas are developed in close collaboration with the client, users and consultants in order to achieve long-lasting buildings and reduced
          life-cycle costs. This value-based approach is the key to our designs of numerous building projects - from complex masterplans to successful architectural landmarks.</p>
