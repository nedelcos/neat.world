          nEAT is formed of a highly multidisciplinary staff of 10+ creative
          professionals and includes architects, interior designers, urban

          construction management, in Romania as well as abroad (USA, Singapore,

        <h3 id="our-goal">
          Our goal is to create vibrant, sustainable buildings that reach beyond
          themselves and become of durable value to the user, to the society and
          the culture that they are built into. We shape and challange the
          physical environment – from masterplans, urban spaces and buildings to
          interior design, – with the overall objective of providing the user
          with a strong, visionary and thoroughly prepared design, adapted to the
          specific context. Our ideas are developed in close collaboration with
          the client, users and consultants in order to achieve long-lasting
          buildings and reduced life-cycle costs. This value-based approach is
          the key to our designs of numerous building projects - from complex
          masterplans to successful architectural landmarks.
